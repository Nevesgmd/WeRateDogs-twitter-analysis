## Understanding the project
First of all, I recommend that you read the report files, especially [wrangle_report.pdf](wrangle_report.pdf), as you will find documentation on the Data Wrangling process in it.

The [act_report](act_report.pdf) file focus on sharing findings and insights of the study, and while it will help you understand the project, it can be read after the study itself.

## Prerequisites to contribute
The data extracted from the Twitter API is in the data folder (just make sure you don't overwrite `tweet-json.txt`), but if you want to access it directly from Twitter you must have an account with [developer account authorization](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). As soon as you have authorization, Twitter will send you API keys that you need.

After downloading/clonning all the files present in this repository, you must choose between one of the following methods. Choose wisely ;)

### Method 1
If you want to contribute, this project requires **Python 3** and its following libraries installed:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/)

Besides, you also need to install a software to use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).  
I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (Python distribution), which already has all the necessary modules and Jupyter Notebook installed.

### Method 2
You can also decide to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), in this case, all you have to do is open the notebook (`.ipynb` file) on Google Colab with your account and install [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/).  
You can find help to install libraries in Google Colab [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51342408/how-do-i-install-python-packages-in-googles-colab).
